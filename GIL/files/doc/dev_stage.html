  <h2>Developing Pipeline Stages</h2>
  <p>All signal data transferred between the Process Model and the External System passes the Transfer Pipeline.
      The Transfer Pipeline is a chain of stages where each stage can monitor or process the passing data. New stages are developed
      by implementing the <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IPipelineStage.html">IPipelineStage</a> interface.
  </p>
  <h3>Processing</h3>
  <p>Calls to the Transfer Pipeline and the stages are done within the same thread handling the PM-adapter. The time of processing
      and the consumed CPU has to be taken into consideration since it may affect the communication with the Process Model resulting
      in, for example, lost frames.</p>  
  <h3>Setup</h3>
  <p>Initially <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IPipelineStage.html#setup(java.lang.String, gil.core.SignalMetadata[], gil.core.SignalMetadata[], gil.common.Parameters)">setup()</a>
      is called by GIL. In this call the stage is handed a specification describing all signals to be passing the stage when
      signal data is transferred  between the process model and the external system. </p>
  <h4>Configuration</h4>
  <p>In the <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IPipelineStage.html#setup(java.lang.String, gil.core.SignalMetadata[], gil.core.SignalMetadata[], gil.common.Parameters)">setup()</a> 
      call, a stage is also handed a implementation specific configuration: GIL reads the <a href="../gil.config.xml">gil.config.xml</a> configuration file and parses the 'pipelineStageSettings' section containing stage
          specific configuration parameters. A <a href="javadoc/gil/common/Parameters.html">Parameters</a> object is created and handed to the stage.</p>

  <h3>Data flow</h3>
  <img src="images/transferPipeline.png" alt=""/>
  <p>When data is transferred between the Process Model and the External System the
  <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IPipelineStage.html#processSignals(java.nio.ByteBuffer, gil.core.SignalMetadata.DataflowDirection)">processSignals()</a> is called on each stage in turn.
  A stage can just monitor the data but may also process and modify the data.</p>

  <h3>Control commands</h3>
  <p>Control commands are executed on the stage as a result of a call on the GIL http API or web interface.</p>
  <p>A stage implementation may or may not supply control commands. By implementing <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IPipelineStage.html#availableCommands()">availableControlCommands()</a> a list
      of possible control commands and there parameters can be supplied to GIL. If there are no control commands available an empty collection
      shall be returned.</p>
  <p>GIL will call <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IPipelineStage.html#invokeControlCommand(gil.core.Command)">invokeControlCommand()</a> to
  execute control commands on a stage.</p>
