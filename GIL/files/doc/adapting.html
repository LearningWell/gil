  <h2>Adapting GIL</h2>
  <p>Adapting GIL is the process of developing adapters or additions to make GIL fit in a specific integration solution, i.e.
    make a specific process model "talk" to a specific external system.</p>
  <p>GIL is developed in Java and adaptions are preferable developed in Java. It is possible to develop adaptions in other languages by
    utilizing Javas support for native code JNI.</p>
  <h3>What has to be done?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If the external system hasn't been integrated before, an ES-adapter has to be implemented. This is done by implementing the
      <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IExternalSystemAdapter.html">IExternalSystemAdapter</a> interface.</li>
    <li>If there is no existing adapter to the process model in question, a PM-adapter has to be implemented. This is done by
      implementing the <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IProcessModelAdapter.html">IProcessModelAdapter</a> interface.</li>
    <li>If data passing to/from the process model and the external system has to be processed or monitored, and there is no existing pipeline stage
      for the purpose, a specific pipeline stage has to be implemented. This is done by implementinig the
      <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IPipelineStage.html">IPipelineStage</a> interface.</li>
    <li>The <a href="../gil.config.xml">gil.config.xml</a> configuration file has to be explored to select and configure the adapters to be used and select and configure
      the chain of stages to be added to the transfer pipeline.</li>
    <li>It has to be defined which data to transfer. This is done by altering the signal exchange list (<a href="sel.html">SEL</a>) which contains
      a list of all signals to be interchanged. The path setting 'signalExchangeList' in <a href="../gil.config.xml">gil.config.xml</a> points to where the SEL-file is located. </li>
  </ul>
