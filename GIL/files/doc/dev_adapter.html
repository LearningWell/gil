  <h2>Developing adapters</h2>
  <p>Adapters for attaching external systems and process models to GIL is quite similar. This document has focus
      on the ES-adapter development but most is applicable also to PM-adapter development.</p>
  <p>Adapter for an external system (ES-adapter) is developed by implementing the
      <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IExternalSystemAdapter.html">IExternalSystemAdapter</a> interface.</p>
  <p>Adapter for a process (PM-adapter) model is developed by implementing the
      <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IProcessModelAdapter.html">IProcessModelAdapter</a> interface.</p>

  <p>Please also see the <a href="../../src/gil/io/example/ExampleESAdapter.java">ExampleESAdapter.java</a>
  and <a href="../../src/gil/io/example/ExamplePMAdapter.java">ExamplePMAdapter.java</a> for example implementations.</p>

  <h3>Adapter capabilities</h3>
  <p>In the adapter interfaces there are a number of operations. Depending on requested features it may be
      that only parts of these operations have to be implemented. Some operations may be left just throwing an
      UnsupportedOperationException as default. Other must return default values e.g. an empty collection if
      no control commands are available.</p>
  <p>ES-adapters must also return a capabilities object when <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IExternalSystemAdapter.html#getCapabilities%28%29">getCapabilities()</a>
      is called. The capabilities object tells GIL the features of the current ES-adapter implementation.</p>

  <h3>Connect and Setup</h3>
  <img src="images/connect.png" alt="" />
  <p>At startup GIL calls <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IExternalSystemAdapter.html#setup(gil.core.SignalMetadata[], gil.core.SignalMetadata[], gil.common.Parameters)">
          setup()</a> on the ES-adapter. In this call the ES-adapter is handed a specification describing all signals to be transferred
          between the process model and the external system.</p>
  <h4>Configuration</h4>
  <p>Adapters are handed implementation specific configuration from GIL in the <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IExternalSystemAdapter.html#setup(gil.core.SignalMetadata[], gil.core.SignalMetadata[], gil.common.Parameters)">
          setup()</a> call.</p>
  <p>GIL reads the <a href="../gil.config.xml">gil.config.xml</a> configuration file and parses the 'adapterSettings' section containing the adapter
          specific configuration parameters. A <a href="javadoc/gil/common/Parameters.html">Parameters</a> object is created and handed to the adapter.</p>



  <h3>Transfer of signal data from External System to Process Model</h3>
  <img src="images/read.png" alt="" />

  <p>GIL will continuously call <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IExternalSystemAdapter.html#readSignalData(java.nio.ByteBuffer)">readSignalData()</a>
      on the ES-adapter when connected. </p>readSignalData() returns 'null' until new data is available. New data is
  added to a transfer queue. Data is retrieved from this queue by a different thread handling the data writes to the Process Model. If
  more data is added to the queue before the previous data has been written, GIL will drop the data and
  increment the counter of dropped frames.

  <h3>Transfer of signal data from the Process Model to the External System</h3>
  Transfers of signal data from the Process Model to the External System is handled much in the same way as transfers in the opposite direction
  described above.
  <h3>Simulator commands</h3>
  <p>Simulator commands are executed on the ES-adapter as a result of an event occurring in the process model.</p>
  <img src="images/simCommands.png" alt="" />
  <p>GIL does continuously call <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IProcessModelAdapter.html#readSimCommands()">readSimCommands()</a> on the
      PM-adapter. This operation returns the events that have occurred since the last call as a collection of simulator commands.
      These commands are added as pending commands to a queue. Commands are retrieved from this queue by a different thread handling
      the execution of the commands on the ES-adapter
      by calling <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IExternalSystemAdapter.html#executeSimCommand(gil.core.Command)">executeSimCommand()</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>Control commands</h3>
  <p>Control commands are executed on the ES-adapter as a result of a call on the GIL http API or web interface.</p>
  <img src="images/controlCommands.png" alt="" />
  <p>An implementation of ES-adapter may or may not supply control commands. By implementing <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IExternalSystemAdapter.html#availableControlCommands()">availableControlCommands()</a> a list
      of possible control commands and there parameters can be supplied to GIL. If there are no control commands available an empty collection
      shall be returned.</p>
  <p>GIL will call <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IControlCommandInvokeable.html#invokeControlCommand(gil.core.Command)">invokeControlCommand()</a> to
  execute control commands.</p>
  <h3>Error handling</h3>
  <p>Methods on adapters may in many cases signal failures by either returning a <a href="javadoc/gil/common/Result.html">Result</a> object indicating failure
      or throwing an exception. The severity of throwing an exception is higher than returning a failure <a href="javadoc/gil/common/Result.html">Result</a> object,
      causing GIL to reconnect to the external system.</p>

  <h3>Close down and Restart</h3>
  <img src="images/closeDown.png" alt="" />
  <p>GIL calls <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IExternalSystemAdapter.html#tearDown()"> tearDown()</a>
      on the adapter on exit or when there is a complete restart. On restart, the adapter shall expect a
      <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IExternalSystemAdapter.html#setup(gil.core.SignalMetadata[], gil.core.SignalMetadata[], gil.common.Parameters)">
          setup()</a> call following the <a href="javadoc/gil/io/IExternalSystemAdapter.html#tearDown()"> tearDown()</a> call.
