  <h1>GIL introduction</h1>
  <div id="methods">
      <p>GIL is a framework and a runtime originally developed by LearningWell AB (<a href="http://www.learningwell.com" target="_blank">www.learningwell.com</a>)
          for Kärnkraftsäkerhet och Utbildning AB (<a href="http://www.ksu.se" target="_blank">www.ksu.se</a>), the center in Sweden for nuclear power plant simulators.</p>
      <p>GIL is used to integrate external systems to the core process models, transferring
          simulator process data and simulator commands. Even though the main use of GIL is in a context
          of nuclear power plant simulators it can be used in any context where real time data and commands
          shall be transferred between a master system (Process Model) and a connected sub system (External System).</p>
      <p>GIL consists of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Common functionality to be reused when integrating external systems to the process models (master system).</li>
      <li>Well defined interfaces to be implemented when adapting GIL to new external systems (sub systems).</li>
      <li>A runtime that handles transfers of processs data and simulator commands between the process model and the external system.</li>
      <li>A http based API (Application Programming Interface) that may be used to interact with the GIL runtime from arbritrary client software.</li>
      <li>A web user interface.</li>
    </ul>

    The intention of GIL is to reduce the work to be done each time a new external system shall be integrated to the
    simulator process models. GIL also provides a common user experience (through the Web interface) to all integration solutions.
    <h3>GIL concept:</h3>
    <img src="images/overview.jpg" width="700" alt="A schematic overview of the GIL concept" />
    <br/><br/>
    <p><span class="highlight">Simulator commands</span> are state change information from the process model to the external system such as RUN, FREEZE, LOAD_IC etc.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">Control commands</span> are arbritrary commands that may control the adapters, external system, process model or the pipeline stages. Such commands
    are specific to each implementation of adapters and pipeline stages. The specification on which commands that are available on a
    specific integration solution can be requested via the http-API or the web-interface. Control commands are invoked via the
    http-API or the web-interface.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">Status</span> is used in a wider sence than just containing status information. Status can contain such information
      as version info, progress info, current state (RUN, FREEZE etc.).</p>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Element</th><th>Description</th></tr>

      <tr><td>External system</td><td>External systems are subsystems of the complete simulator but not part of
          the core simulator process models. Since they are not part of the core process models they do not share the same common
          areas of global variables. Therefor data has to be interchanged between the external systems and the process model and
          this can be done by using GIL.</td></tr>

      <tr><td>ES-adapter</td><td>GIL provides core functionality to interchange data between the process model and the external system. However,
          to adapt each external systems unique interface to GIL, an ES-adapter has to be developed. An ES-adapter is developed according
          to a well defined interface which is part of the GIL framework.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>IntegrationExecutive</td><td>This is the core control logic that handles transfers between the process model and the external system.</td></tr>

      <tr><td>Transfer pipeline</td><td><p>Data to and from the process model and the external system passes through the transfer pipeline. The pipeline
        consists of a chain of stages. Each stage are aware of the type of data passing through and may monitor or alter the data.</p>
          <p>The transfer pipeline can contain zero stages to leave passing data unaffected and save CPU.</p>
          <p>The transfer pipeline is built on a plug-in architecture, stages may be added to pipeline by altering the gil.config.xml file.</p>
          <p>There is stages for certain tasks developed in the GIL framework. New stages may be developed according to a well defined interface which is part of the GIL framework.</p></td></tr>

      <tr><td>Stage</td><td>Stages are plug-ins in the Transfer pipeline.</td></tr>

      <tr><td>Process model</td><td>The meaning of the term process model is the core simulator functionality. The process model
          acts as the master. GIL detects simulator state changes (RUN, FREEZE etc.) and frame (time step) changes by monitoring
          the process model.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>PM-adapter</td><td>The PM-adapter adapts GIL to different process models. A PM-adapter is developed according
          to a well defined interface which is part of the GIL framework.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Web-server</td><td>An embedded web-server is part of the GIL package to remove the necessity of a web-server on the
        machine hosting GIL. The Web-server hosts the http-API and the GIL web-based user interface. By pointing your web-browser
        to http://{host}/index.html you can access the web user interface.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>API</td><td>A client may interact with the GIL runtime using a http based API. Se the 
          <a href="apidoc/index.html" target="">GIL API Documentation</a> for instructions on how to use the API.
